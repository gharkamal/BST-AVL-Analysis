# BST-AVL-Analysis

  This project is an analysis of the effiency both AVL and BST can provide. 
  The project could be run using either eclipse or terminal via the tester class. 
  The tester classes will be able to provide detailed discription on the search effiency. 
 
  For the BST and AVL, we tested the insertion method by setting n = 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000.  Once we set timers in the code
  we saw the level of efficiency incorporated by AVL and BST. We recorded the outputs and transferred the times against the number 
  of input on a graph. Comparing both graphs we were able to conclude that BST had a more efficient insertion and deletion, as the
  balancing was not necessary in comparison to AVL, which has more running time because it requires extra amount of work to balance 
  a node if it is not. 



Looking at both charts for the BST and AVL insertion and removal. We were able to see that the AVL tree took an approximately 
O (n^2) compared to the BST which took about O (n). This shows efficiency difference between the two, as AVL required more time 
because of the necessary balancing that needed to be done.
